## Description
A simple python script for sorting words based on frequencies read from a txt file.
The script consists of two functions:
* Word_Order_Frequency_One_Book()
* Word_Order_Frequency_Two_Books()

These book(s) are read and their words are listed on a table drawn in command line.
Additionally, a small improvement was added where word list indexing was done more intelligently (or at least that's what my 2021-self thought.)
